# Using Indexers
Indexers are a syntactic convenience that enable you to create a class, struct, or interface that client applications can access just as an array. Indexers are most frequently implemented in types whose primary purpose is to encapsulate an internal collection or array. </br>
For example you can find the weekday with indexer.
# How to use
```C#
WeekDays day = new WeekDays();
Console.WriteLine(day[5]);
```
